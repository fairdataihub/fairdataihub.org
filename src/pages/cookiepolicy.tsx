          Cookies are small files that websites send to your device that the
          sites then use to monitor you and remember certain information about
          you — like what&apos;s in your shopping cart on an e-commerce site, or
          your login information.

        <p className="content">
          As part of our web analytics overhaul, we have stopped using Google
          Analytics and switched to using Umami instead. Umami is an open
          source, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics. and provides
          a powerful web analytics solution that does not violate the privacy of
          our users. Additionally, we self-host Umami so that an unrelated third
          party is not in complete control of your data. This also means that we
          are completely open and transparent about how we use your data. If you
          would like to see exactly what we track, you can view our analytics at
          the following link:{` `}
