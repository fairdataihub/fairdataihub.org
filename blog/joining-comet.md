I'm excited to announce that our team at the FAIR Data Innovations Hub is now participating in the [Collaborative Metadata Enrichment Task Force (COMET)](https://www.cometadata.org), an initiative designed to enhance the completeness, consistency, and interoperability of metadata across research ecosystems. As we've experienced firsthand in our biomedical research work, inadequate persistent identifier (PID) metadata often hampers resource discovery and reuse potential. Our recent challenges [evaluating OCT datasets for age-related macular degeneration](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2025.110342) highlighted how disconnected research outputs create unnecessary barriers to scientific progress.

COMET addresses these issues by democratizing metadata enrichment through an inclusive, community-driven approach. Unlike existing siloed systems, COMET will distribute the metadata curation workload across stakeholders while maintaining high standards through responsible governance. I believe this collaborative model aligns perfectly with our mission at the FAIR Data Innovations Hub to make FAIR practices accessible to all researchers. If you're interested in learning more about why we're joining this effort, you can read [my full interview on the COMET website](https://doi.org/10.7269/C1BC72). I invite other organizations invested in advancing open scholarship to join us in this important initiative. By working together, we can create a more interconnected and discoverable research ecosystem that properly rewards researchers for sharing their work while accelerating scientific discovery.
