We are developing posters.science through a new grant from the [Navigation Fund](https://www.navigation.org/).

## ‚ú® Why Posters Matter

Every year, millions of scientific posters are presented at conferences around the world. They often mark the first public disclosure of new research ideas and results, from novel methods and fresh datasets to early hypotheses and unpublished findings. Posters spark hallway conversations and surface insights well before papers are published.

## üóëÔ∏è Vanishing Knowledge

Despite their value, most posters quietly vanish into trash cans or hard drives after the conference ends (Table 1). They‚Äôre rarely preserved, indexed, or cited. Some researchers share their posters on platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, and F1000Research. But after conducting an in-depth investigation (work in progress - results will be presented in an upcoming paper), we found fewer than 100k posters online. That‚Äôs a tiny fraction compared to the tens of millions likely presented over the past decade. Even when shared, essential metadata like conference name or keywords are missing, making posters difficult to find and reuse by the intended audience.

**Table 1**. Key metrics about posters

## üöÄ Enters Posters.science

That‚Äôs where [posters.science](https://posters.science/) comes in. We‚Äôre building a free and open-source platform that lets researchers easily share and discover posters that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). The platform will streamline sharing to trusted repositories like Zenodo and Figshare, while using AI-powered tools to automatically extract rich metadata and generate a machine-friendly version of each poster (what we are calling poster.json) to minimize effort of the researchers.

But we‚Äôre not stopping at here. Posters.science will also include smart-search capabilities to help researchers find posters and make discoveries by directly asking complex, meaningful questions like: ‚ÄúWhat new discoveries were presented at ARVO 2025 regarding the connection between the eye and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease?‚Äù. We will register not only posters shared through posters.science in our database but also all openly available posters on the net to create the largest registry of posters.

By facilitating the preservation, indexing, and reuse of posters, we aim to unlock their untapped potential and turn these once-temporary artifacts into enduring research assets.

## üìÖ Coming Summer 2026

We‚Äôre just getting started on building posters.science. Over the next 10 months, we‚Äôll be designing and developing the platform, building and validating our metadata extraction and smart search tools, and working closely with researchers to conduct beta testing. Our goal is to release a public version by Summer 2026.
