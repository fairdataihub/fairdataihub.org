## üìù Event Description

**USRSE‚Äô25** is the third annual conference of the **United States Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE)**, gathering research software engineers, developers, scientists, and team leaders to explore the evolving role of software in research. This year‚Äôs theme, **‚ÄúCode, Practices, and People‚Äù**, emphasizes the tools, methodologies, and community efforts that support effective and sustainable research software development. The conference will feature sessions on secure and reproducible coding, open-source infrastructure, workforce development, leadership, and collaborations that advance both science and software.

The program of the conference will be available [here](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/program/).

## üí° Our Role / Contribution

Bhavesh Patel will deliver two presentations at USRSE‚Äô25 focused on advancing the FAIRness of research software. The first talk will introduce the work of the **Actionable Guidelines for FAIR Research Software (Actionable FAIR4RS) Task Force**, formed under the **Research Software Alliance (ReSA)**. The task force is translating the FAIR4RS Principles into practical guidelines to make any research software FAIR. The second talk will highlight the latest developments in **Codefair**, an open-source platform that automates FAIR compliance for research software through GitHub and a user-friendly web app.
