The FAIR Data Innovations Hub is one of the organizations involved under the Bridge2AI under the `SalutoGenesis Grand Challenge`. We will be showcasing our brand new platform, [FAIRhub](https://fairhub.io) at the Bridge2AI Open House. FAIRhub is destined to be your new home for AI-ready clinical data. We will be discussing the data we have collected so far and how it will be available to other researchers.

## About the Open House

The Bridge2AI Open House will focus on collaborative approaches, learn about current considerations, explore new datasets, and discuss other key issues related to bridging the gap from biomedical information to AI. Sessions will be centered around the activities of the Bridge2AI Data Generation Projects, which stemmed from Grand Challenges put forth by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Four Grand Challenges are:

- [Bridge2AI for Clinical Care](https://chorus4ai.org/) (Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards (CHoRUS) for Equitable AI)
- [Functional Genomics Grand Challenge](https://cm4ai.org/) (Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI) Data Generation Project)..
- [Precision Public Health (Voice) Grand Challenge](https://www.b2ai-voice.org/) (Voice as a Biomarker of Health – Building an ethically sourced, bioaccoustic database to understand disease like never before).
- [Salutogenesis Grand Challenge](https://aireadi.org/) (The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project)

The Open House will consist of both Bridge2AI-wide sessions on cross-cutting themes, such as ethical considerations for biomedical AI, data exploration sessions to showcase the new datasets being developed by the Grand Challenges, and the launching of new data challenges around these datasets. The Open House will emphasize the sharing of expertise and insight through shared presentations, with live demonstrations during the event.

The Open House will be held on the afternoon of April 18th and all-day April 19th(till 3:00 pm for the main sessions).
