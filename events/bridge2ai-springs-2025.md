The AI-READI team will be at the Bridge2AI All Hands Conference to give various updates about our project during the first 2 days and provide a hands-on demonstration with the AI-READI dataset on the third day.

## üìù Event Description

The All Hands Conference (May 20-21) will be an opportunity for researchers and experts to engage in vibrant discussions. The NIH Common Fund‚Äôs Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2Al) program will propel biomedical research forward by setting the stage for widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (Al) that tackles complex biomedical challenges beyond human intuition. The biomedical research community generates a wealth of data, but most of these data are not suitable for machine learning because they are incomplete. By bringing technological and biomedical experts together with social scientists and humanists, the Bridge2Al program will help bring solutions to this deficit.

The Bridge2Al Open House (May 22) will focus on collaborative approaches, learn about current considerations, explore new datasets, and discuss other key issues related to bridging the gap from biomedical information to Al. Sessions will be centered around the activities of the Bridge2Al Data Generation Projects, which stemmed from Grand Challenges put forth by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

## üí° Our Role / Contribution

**Aydan Gasimova** and **Bhavesh Patel** will join many of our AI-READI team members to present progress and outcomes of our project and help with the Open House.

**Bhavesh Patel** will give a talk titled "Open Data Sharing in the Era of AI: Challenges and Opportunities" as part of the Science Talks session. The talk will discuss what we coined as pseudo-reidentification risks and introduce a new swiss-cheese model of open data sharing.

**Aydan Gasimova** and **Bhavesh Patel** will also help during the Open House. In particular, **Bhavesh Patel** will walk participants through the access process for our AI-READI dataset.
