## Overview

Research software refers to any software created during the research process or for a research purpose. Research software comes in various formats, such as Python scripts, desktop software, or web applications, and is developed for various purposes, including data visualization, data analysis, computational modeling, or artificial intelligence (AI) development. Research software has become a critical element of scientific research, and making it reusable is therefore critical to enable the reproducibility of research results, prevent duplicate efforts, and ultimately increase the pace of discoveries. In this webinar, we will introduce the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for Research Software (or FAIR4RS principles), which are adaptations of the FAIR data principles but tailored specifically for research software. These principles provide a set of aspirational instructions for optimizing the reusability of research software. We will then present the FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines, which are a set of minimal, actionable, step-by-step instructions we have established to easily make biomedical research software compliant with the FAIR4RS Principles. We will also introduce a new task force started under the Research Software Alliance (ReSA) that aims to build upon the work of the FAIR-BioRS guidelines to establish actionable guidelines for making any research software FAIR. Finally, we will provide simple instructions that anyone can follow to start making their software FAIR and also present a tool called Codefair that helps to make research software FAIR without breaking a sweat.
