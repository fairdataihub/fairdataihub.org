This year marks our fourth year in attendance to BOSC! We are always delighted to join BOSC and advocate for open science. We will discuss [Codefair](/codefair), a GitHub app we developed in 2024 for easily making research software FAIR. This year we bring new features, improvements and an overhaul to the UI design that we are excited to share with everyone. [Dorian Portillo](/team#Dorian-Portillo) will be representing the team and presenting a poster on the latest developments. More details on the poster and Codefair are available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fairdataihub/codefair-BOSC-2025).

## About the Conference

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been held annually since 2000. BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSCâ€™s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.
