## üìù Event Description

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been held annually since 2000. BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC‚Äôs broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

## üí° Our Role / Contribution

This year marks our fourth year attending BOSC, and we‚Äôre excited to return to advocate for open science and share our latest work. We‚Äôll present **[Codefair](/codefair)**, a GitHub App we developed in 2024 to help researchers make their research software **FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)**.

This year we're bringing new features, improved guidance, and an overhaul to our UI that we are excited to share with everyone.
**[Dorian Portillo](/team#Dorian-Portillo)** will represent our team and present a poster detailing the latest developments.

Dorian will also participate in the **[CoFest](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2025/ismb-collaborationfest-2025/)** and propose a research study evaluating README file improvements generated by three different large language models (LLMs). The study aims to assess whether LLM-generated enhancements improve clarity, completeness without hallucinations, and overall quality of README files in research software repositories as the README file is the primary point of entry for users.

Additional, **[Bhavesh Patel](/team#Bhavesh-Patel)** will give a lightning talk introducing the Actionable Guidelines for FAIR Research Software (Actionable FAIR4RS) Task Force, formed under the Research Software Alliance (ReSA). The task force is translating the FAIR4RS Principles into practival guidelines to make any research software FAIR.
