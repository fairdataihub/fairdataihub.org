## üìù Event Description

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) has been held annually since 2000. BOSC is organized by the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community.

Since its inception, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC‚Äôs broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

## üí° Our Role / Contribution

This year marks our fourth year attending BOSC, and we‚Äôre excited to return to advocate for open science and share our latest work. We‚Äôll present **[Codefair](/codefair)**, a GitHub App we developed in 2024 to help researchers make their research software **FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)**.

This year we're bringing new features, improved guidance, and a overhaul to our UI that we are excited to share with everyone.
**[Dorian Portillo](/team#Dorian-Portillo)** will represent our team and present a poster detailing the latest developments.
