The AI-READI team will be at the Bridge2AI All Hands Conference to give various updates about our project during the first 2 days and provide a hands-on demonstration with the AI-READI dataset on the third day. 

## About the Open House

The Bridge2Al Open House will focus on collaborative approaches, learn about current considerations, explore new datasets, and discuss other key issues related to bridging the gap from biomedical information to Al. Sessions will be centered around the activities of the Bridge2Al Data Generation Projects, which stemmed from Grand Challenges put forth by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

## About the All Hands Conference

May 2025 All Hands Conference will be an opportunity for researchers and experts to engage in vibrant discussions. The NIH Common Fund’s Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2Al) program will propel biomedical research forward by setting the stage for widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (Al) that tackles complex biomedical challenges beyond human intuition. The biomedical research community generates a wealth of data, but most of these data are not suitable for machine learning because they are incomplete. By bringing technological and biomedical experts together with social scientists and humanists, the Bridge2Al program will help bring solutions to this deficit.
