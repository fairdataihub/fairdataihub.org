## 📝 Event Description

The **Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting** is a premier global event for advancing vision research. The 2025 meeting will feature a special course titled **“Artificial Intelligence for Ophthalmic Research"**, which explores foundational concepts and emerging tools in the AI/ML space for vision research.

Details about the course are available on the [course page](https://www.arvo.org/annual-meeting/program/education-sessions/education-sessions-ai/).

## 💡 Our Role / Contribution

**Bhavesh Patel** will present a talk titled **“What is FAIR and AI-Ready for Datasets?”** as part of the session on fundamentals of model training and federated learning. This presentation will introduce the concept of AI-readiness for datasets, with a focus on the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) Principles. Bhavesh will discuss how these principles ensure technical readiness for machine reuse and demonstrate their application using the AI-READI dataset, developed as part of the NIH Bridge2AI program. This talk will highlight both conceptual foundations and practical implementation for clinical research datasets in ophthalmology.

**Bhavesh Patel** will also help the AI-READI team with the hands on course using the AI-READI dataset.
