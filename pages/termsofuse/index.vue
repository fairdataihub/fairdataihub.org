        date of first use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
        the above exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions do not
        allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above
        limitation may not apply to you.
      </p>

        consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages

        work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the
        following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to
        17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:

        substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the

        calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our

        Site. Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall
        indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound
        by the terms and conditions of such changes. Dispute Resolution. Please
        read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract
        with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for
        MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</h3>

      <p>
        All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any
        product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved
        informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding
        arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration
        Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall
        be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the
        Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees,
        predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all
        authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods
        provided under the Terms.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">
        Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution
      </h3>

      <p>
        Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to
        the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and
        basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the
        Company should be sent to: 11107 Roselle St. Ste #211 San Diego, CA
        92121. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to
        resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not
        resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is
        received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount
        of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the
        arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the
        award to which either party is entitled.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Arbitration Rules</h3>

      <p>
        Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration
        Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that
        offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available
        to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR
        Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the
        arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the
        Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are
        available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The
        arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any
        claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less
        than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
        binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party
        seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
        award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the
        right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any
        hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence,
        unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties
        agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall
        give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any
        oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may
        be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator
        grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that
        the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the
        Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party
        shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the
        arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the
        ADR Provider.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">
        Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration
      </h3>

      <p>
        If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be
        conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
        submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating
        the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal
        appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the
        parties.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Time Limits</h3>

      <p>
        If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must
        be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and
        within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Authority of Arbitrator</h3>

      <p>
        If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and
        liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be
        consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or
        parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions
        dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
        authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary
        remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the
        AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
        statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions
        on which the award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to
        award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
        have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the
        Company.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Waiver of Jury Trial</h3>

      <p>
        THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO
        TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead
        electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration
        under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically
        more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in
        a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event
        any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or
        federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or
        otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead
        electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</h3>

      <p>
        All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement
        must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a
        class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be
        arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other
        customer or user.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Confidentiality</h3>

      <p>
        All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly
        confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless
        otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from
        submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this
        Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or
        equitable relief.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Severability</h3>

      <p>
        If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the
        law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
        then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and
        shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in
        full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Right to Waive</h3>

      <p>
        Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration
        Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.
        Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this
        Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Survival of Agreement</h3>

      <p>
        This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
